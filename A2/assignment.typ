== What is the likelihood and posterior? <b-what-is-the-likelihood-and-posterior>
Using the model above and the function f , write down the likelihood of the data (i.e., a formula for the probability of the data given the parameters of the model). Also, write down a function that is proportional to the posterior density for the parameters.

== <c>
Write an R function that takes as input values for two parameters $theta = lr((theta_1 , theta_2 , theta_3))$ and $theta^(\*) = lr((theta_1^(\*) , theta_2^(\*) , theta_3^(\*)))$ and computes a function that is equal to $ log lr((frac(
  pi lr((theta^(\*) divides upright(d a t a))),
  pi lr((theta divides upright(d a t a))),

))) $ i.e., the logarithm of the quotient of the posterior densities for $theta^*$ and $theta$

== <d>
Implement an MCMC algorithm that generates a Markov chain of length 10000 with limiting distribution equal to the posterior for $theta$.

Use a proposal distribution which adds to each parameter a normally distributed variable with expectation zero and standard deviation $0.4$. Find a starting value for the chain by studying what values for $theta$ might be reasonable for the given data.

Produce trace plots (plots mapping simulated values for $theta_i$ against its index i) for the parameters $theta_1 , theta_2$, and $theta_3$.

== <e>
Compute numerically the predicted probability that an animal at pollutant concentration $x = 0.7$ and temperature $y = 19$ will have the disease.

Also, compute the predicted probability that among 10 animals exposed to this temperature and this pollutant concentration, 9 will have the disease.

= Branching Process <exercise-2-branching-process>
Consider a branching process where the offspring distribution is a Poisson distribution with parameter $lambda = 1.4$.

== <a>
Use R to compute the probability that such a process will go extinct.

Find:

#figure(

  caption: [
    Branching Process
  ],
)<fig:branching_process>

Consider the process whose first 5 steps are pictured in @fig:branching_process. Assume its offspring distribution is $"Poisson"(1.4)$. What is the probability that the continuation of this process will go extinct?


// notes:
$ Z_5 = 11 $

Assume process starts 11 times?

$ P(E | Z_5 = 11) = 11 e ? $ 


== <c-1>
Now, consider instead a branching process with a $"Poisson"(lambda)$ offspring distribution where $lambda$ is unknown. We assume a prior $pi(lambda) prop_lambda 1 / lambda$. Assume now that @fig:branching_process depicts a realization of this process.

What is the resulting likelihood for $lambda$? What is the posterior distribution for $lambda$?

// notes 
$ Z_n = sum_(i = 1)^(Z_n - 1) X_i =  sum_(i = 1)^(Z_n - 1) frac(lambda^k, k!) e^-lambda $

== <d-1>
We want to compute the probability of extinction of a branching process of the type of question (c), taking into account the uncertainty in $lambda$. The extinction probability can then be written as an integral of a product of two functions of $lambda$. Write down this integral and compute its value with R using numerical integration.

$ P(E) = integral_lambda pi(lambda) P(E | lambda) d lambda $


== <e-1>
Consider the process in in @fig:branching_process, depicting a realization of a branching process with a $"Poisson"(lambda)$ offspring distribution with unknown $lambda$, as in question (c). Compute the probability that the continuation of this process will go extinct.
